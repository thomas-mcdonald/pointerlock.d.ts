# pointerlock.d.ts

pointerlock.d.ts is a Typescript definition file for the HTML [Pointer Lock API][spec]. I (think) I've fully covered the spec - it's not a large API.

Throwing it out there in case it's useful for anyone else - Google doesn't suggest this is currently available elsewere.

## Usage

Add a reference to `pointerlock.d.ts`:

```ts
/// <reference path='pointerlock.d.ts' />
```
